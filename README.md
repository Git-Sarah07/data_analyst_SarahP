# Project Description: Descriptive Analysis of Student Complaints at UCW
# Project Title: Understanding student complaints at UCW
- Objective: The primary goal of this project is to conduct a descriptive analysis of complaints by students at UCW. Through this analysis, we aim to summarize key characteristics, identify trends, and generate insights that can improve the procedures at UCW that would lower the complaints from students and improve the response rate for complaints. 
- Dataset: The dataset includes transactional data from UCW over the past year, containing the following key features:
·      Student  ID:  A student’s unique Identity number 
.    Student Name: A student’s name 
.    Student Complaint: The complaint generated by the student 
.    Complaint Date: The date on which complaint is lodged 
.    Status: whether the complaint has been resolved or not 
.    Resolution Data: The date at which the complaint was resolved
.    Comments:  The general comments on the complaints 
- Methodology:
    Data Collection and Preparation:
    Load the dataset using data analysis tools, Excel- csv format was used here 
    Perform data cleaning to address missing values, correct data types, and remove duplicates.
- Descriptive Statistics:
  Calculate summary statistics for key variables, including:
    Complaint date and Complaint Resolution Date
    Student Complaint
    Status of complaint whether resolved or not.
- Insights and Findings:
 Summarize the insights derived from the analysis
-  Recommendations:
   Provide actionable recommendations based on the findings 
- Tools and Technologies:
·       Excel for data analysis
·      AWS Athena
- Deliverables:
·      A detailed report summarizing the methods, findings, and recommendations.
·      Visualizations and dashboards to present key insights clearly.
- This descriptive analysis project aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of student complaints, enabling UCW to optimize its operations and enhance student satisfaction.
 




# Data Quality Control
# Project Description: Data Quality Control Initiative at University Canada West
# Project Title: Implementation of Data Quality Control Measures at University Canada West
- Objective: The primary objective of this project is to establish a comprehensive Data Quality Control (DQC) framework at University Canada West (UCW). This framework will ensure the accuracy, completeness, consistency, and reliability of the organization's data, enhancing decision-making processes and overall business performance.
- Scope: The project will focus on the following key areas:
		Data Protection : Here we protect personal identifier information
		Data Governance :Here we ensure Data Quality and Data Privacy 
		Data Monitoring and Controlling : Here we observe data and take action if required to protect its integrity.

- Methodology:
-  Current State Assessment:
   Conduct a thorough analysis of current data sources, workflows, and existing data quality challenges.
   Identify the key datasets that significantly impact business operations and decision-making.
-   Data Profiling:
  Utilize data profiling tools to assess the quality of identified datasets, focusing on completeness, uniqueness, validity, consistency, and accuracy.
  Document findings to highlight areas requiring immediate attention.
-    Establish Data Quality Metrics:
  Define clear data quality metrics and key performance indicators (KPIs) to evaluate and track data quality over time, such as error rates, duplicate records, and compliance with data standards.
-    Data Cleansing Processes:
   Develop and implement procedures for data cleansing, which may include:
  Removing duplicates and correcting errors.
  Standardizing data formats and values.
  Filling in missing values using appropriate imputation techniques.
-  Validation Rules and Procedures:
  Set up validation rules for new data entries to reduce the risk of poor-quality data being introduced into the system.
  Create data entry guidelines to promote consistency and accuracy.
-  Monitoring and Reporting:
  Implement monitoring tools and dashboards that provide real-time data quality metrics and alerts for significant deviations.
  Schedule regular reports to review data quality trends and performance against established KPIs.

-   Tools and Technologies:
·      AWS services including 
		Data Glu, Cloudtrail, AWS KMS and Replication Rules
-   Deliverables:
·      Documentation of data quality metrics and KPIs being tracked.
·      Cleaned and validated datasets ready for analysis and reporting.
·      A monitoring dashboard that visualizes data quality metrics in real-time in AWS services
